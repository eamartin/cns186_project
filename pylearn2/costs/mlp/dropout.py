    This paper suggests including each unit with probability p during training,
    then multiplying the outgoing weights by p at the end of training.
    We instead include each unit with probability p and divide its
    state by p during training. Note that this means the initial weights should
    be multiplied by p relative to Hinton's.
    The SGD learning rate on the weights should also be scaled by p^2 (use
    W_lr_scale rather than adjusting the global learning rate, because the
    learning rate on the biases should not be adjusted).

        During training, each input to each layer is randomly included or excluded
        for each example. The probability of inclusion is independent for each input
        and each example. Each layer uses "default_input_include_prob" unless that
        layer's name appears as a key in input_include_probs, in which case the input
        inclusion probability is given by the corresponding value.

        Each feature is also multiplied by a scale factor. The scale factor for each
        layer's input scale is determined by the same scheme as the input probabilities.
